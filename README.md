Email Classifier.
This is a raw page that will be heavily edited.

This is an attempt to classify office email. The 'result' or 'match' of an email is either urgent, or important

This is targeted at office email, taking into account (not in this order):

1) Org structure

2) 'Spam' from builders, or mailing lists

3) People that have been responded to earlier

4) Previously read email

5) Calendar invites

6) Dates => if an important, actionable 'thing' hasnt been addressed, it should bubble to the top, irritating the mail user.


It will use font size, colors, sort order and swimlanes to bug the email user. (Bug => Annoy, pester by using these visual artifices)

It is expected that the user has a working account that has this information previously.

I have this horrbile problem where I decide to reply to some email and it slips my mind. This comee back and bites me later. I come off as incompetent for not staying in touch with email. This is an attempt to use automation to clone brain rules into software thereby extending oneself. 

Will be using either scala or clojure => TBD
Defenitely use machine learning.
